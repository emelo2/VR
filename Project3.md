## Project 3 Proposal: Traveler's Adventure

The idea for this project is a world that is waiting to be explored. I plan to have a large forest area with a lot of objects that can be interact with. My idea comes from the Little Red Riddinghood, you are the player that is trying to reach grandmother's house, but on the way there are obstacles that need to be completed in order to keep going forward.  
Creating this game in VR would be useful because this world is meant to be explored and most of the object will be interactable, this will allow the user to be more immerse than just playing with a keyboard and mouse.  
  
This game will be built with Unity 3D and meant to be used on the HTC Vive.
I plan to use free 3D objects from the Unity asset store as well.
