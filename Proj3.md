Project 3 involved designing an office where we normally have class.  It was interesting trying to find objects and designing them as well in order to fit my taste.  It was a great way to get started on unity.  For my project I added textures to the floor and walls: 

I created a work area, a meeting area and a relaxation area.  

I was able to gather 3D object from two different online sources, turbosquid and free3d.  I did modify most of the objects too, for example for all the plants in the room, I decided I wanted the plants to be a different shade tha nthey came in so I changed the color.  Also most of the furniture in the room was wooden colored, but I did not really like the shades, so I decided to make the furniture black and white, except for the small coffee table.

Most of the small objects are interactive and can be stacked up.
