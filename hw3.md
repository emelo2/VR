## HW3

For this homework we had to shrink ourselves as tho we were the size of a mug. As you become the size of smaller objects you can start to loose details on the surfaces.  This means that objects will look less real. Additionally it was very hard to navigate like this, but at the same time its a great way to allow the user to expirience somthing like this.  In real life, unless we invent shrinking devices, we could never feel like ants because we live in a world where we are bigger.  It was interesting to see the mug suddenly cover more of the screen than if had before and that is what makes it feel more real.
