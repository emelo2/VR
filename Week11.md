Holoportation Analysis

Holoportation is a new type of technology that is able to create a 3D image of a person and with the use of a headset like HoloLens anyone from any place can see.  It's a very interesting new type technology that would enable a different type of communication between humans.  As of now people tend to communicate through voice calls, text and video calls, which are just flat 2D images, and for the most part that is enough, but there could be situations where a 3D interaction could be useful.  In the video that is on the website they mention having the oportunity to talk to family members that is thousands of miles away would be very appealing since this technology allows real feel of face-to-face interaction. I also think that when learning something that is done physically , for example learning to do a new yoga pose, Holoportation could also be useful. Another aspect could be for doctors examining their patients from home or collaborating on work. 
Holoportation allows for face-to-face feel of a conversation, but that is where it stops since it doesn't allow for physical touch. Microsoft was able to make a mobile version that uses only 2 cameras and can be used while in a moving car, the original version uses a lot more cameras which give a more high quality 3D image, but the 2 cameras allow for a lower bandwidth which is necesssary when being mobile.
Overall this is a fairly new technology that has great potential to grow.
